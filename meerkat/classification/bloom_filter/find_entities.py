##THINK!
#Red Roof Inn, a three term bloom filter.
# We should know if Red leads to Red Roof which in term leads to Red Roof Inn.
# If each merchant stored its partials, the logic should be:
# 1. Store each partial, including the entire term in partials.
# 2. When scanning, start at first term and scan partials,
#    find the longest partial you can and then check full merchant bloom
# 3. Note that you may wish to remove tokens that have
#    already been found as locations (could be important)
